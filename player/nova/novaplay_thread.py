novaplay_thread.py — shared main-thread dispatcher.
==================================================================
Leaf module: imports ONLY from enigma, never from other plugin modules,
so plugin.py / novaplay_subtitles.py / anything else can import it with
zero circular-import risk. Replaces the private copies of
callInMainThread() (novaplay_subtitles' MAIN queue — and plugin.py's
CMIT queue if you ever choose to switch it over too).

Why this exists: two modules each carried their own identical
callInMainThread implementation, duplicated specifically to avoid
circular imports. A leaf module that nobody imports *from* makes the
duplication unnecessary.

Changes in this revision (audit fixes):
  * callInMainThread() now ALWAYS (re)arms the timer after enqueueing.
    The old version armed only when the timer was freshly created — an
    item enqueued while the drain loop was mid-callback depended on the
    drain's own re-check, which doesn't cover every eTimer re-entrant
    start() behavior across images. One-shot start on an idle timer is
    idempotent; on a pending one it just resets the 50ms.
  * Timer-construction failure now drains via the twisted reactor —
    items can't sit in the queue forever if eTimer is unavailable.
  * Callback exceptions are logged to /tmp/novaplay.log instead of
    vanishing. A swallowed NameError from a half-applied edit used to
    look like "the screen just didn't update" with zero trace.
